<h1> Preprocessing IMDb Data</h1>

<p> imdb.csv contains movie data from IMDb, a online database containing movie reviews and movie information. Given the raw data
provided in the imdb.csv, I cleaned the data by writing a python script that uses the tools provided by a software
library. I was able to manipulate by getting rid of uneccessary columns, account for missing values, replacing values(Nan, N/A, and Null),
fixing unicode, filtering movie score and durations, deleting rows with outliers, and writing the cleaned data into another csv file. </p>
